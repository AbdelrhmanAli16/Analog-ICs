# Analog Electronics Course

This folder contains the complete materials for the **Analog Electronics Basics** course.
a continuation of foundational analog design, focused on amplifiers, frequency response, and differential circuits.
The course combines theory, practical labs, and problem-solving to build solid analog circuit design skills.
