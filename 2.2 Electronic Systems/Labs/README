# Labs â€“ Electronic Systems

This folder contains the laboratory work completed for the **Electronic Systems** course.
All labs were performed using both **Proteus simulation** and **hardware testboard implementation**, allowing practical validation of theoretical concepts covered in lectures.

##  Topics Covered

1. **Active Filters**  
   - Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass Filters  
   - Butterworth and Chebyshev implementations  
   - Frequency response verification using virtual instruments  

2. **Oscillators**  
   - RC Phase Shift and Wien Bridge Oscillators  
   - LC and Crystal Oscillators  
   - Signal generation observed on virtual oscilloscope  

3. **Multivibrators**  
   - Astable, Monostable, and Bistable configurations  
   - Timing analysis and output waveform observation  

4. **Voltage Regulators**  
   - Zener-based linear regulators  
   - IC regulators (e.g., 7805, LM317)  
   - Load regulation and ripple suppression tests
