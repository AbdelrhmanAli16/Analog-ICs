# Electronic Systems

This folder documents the **Electronic Systems** course as part of my personal journey in Analog Integrated Circuit (IC) design.
It includes structured lectures, problem sheets and solutions, hands-on lab experiments, and complete simulations — with a focus on both theoretical depth and practical implementation.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into **two main parts**, each exploring a core area of analog circuit systems:

### 🔹 Part I – Active Filters
- Introduction to Filters  
- Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass Filters  
- Butterworth, Chebyshev, Bessel Filters  
- KHN Biquad, Multiple Feedback, and State Variable Filters

### 🔹 Part II – Oscillators & Regulators
- RC, LC, Crystal, and Wien Bridge Oscillators  
- Astable, Monostable, and Bistable Multivibrators  
- Linear Voltage Regulators and IC Regulators

### Labs

All lab work was simulated in **Proteus** and then implemented on **testboards**. Topics include:
- Active filter response measurements  
- Oscillator waveform generation  
- Timing analysis of multivibrators  
- Regulator performance under different loads

Each lab includes:
- Circuit files  
- Simulation screenshots  
- Real hardware images  
- Full experimental reports
