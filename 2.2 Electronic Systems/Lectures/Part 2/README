# Lectures – Electronic Systems (Part II: Oscillators, Multivibrators & Regulators)

This section contains lecture material from the second part of the *Electronic Systems* course, focusing on signal generation and power regulation circuits.
The topics cover a variety of oscillator types, waveform generators, multivibrator circuits, and voltage regulators—essential building blocks in analog and mixed-signal systems.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Wave Generators & Oscillators**
- **RC Oscillators** (e.g., Phase-shift, Wien Bridge)
- **LC Oscillators** (e.g., Hartley, Colpitts)
- **Crystal Oscillators** for high-frequency stability
- Criteria for sustained oscillation (Barkhausen condition)
- Practical design and startup conditions

### 2. **Multivibrators**
- **Astable Multivibrator** – Generates square waves without external triggering  
- **Monostable Multivibrator** – One-shot pulse generator  
- **Bistable Multivibrator** – Flip-flop-like behavior  
- Timing diagrams and pulse width control  
- Application in timing, switching, and digital interfacing

### 3. **Voltage Regulators**
- **Linear Regulators** (Series and Shunt types)  
- **Zener Diode-based Regulation**  
- **IC Regulators** (e.g., 78XX, 79XX families)  
- Load regulation, line regulation, dropout voltage  
- Efficiency considerations
