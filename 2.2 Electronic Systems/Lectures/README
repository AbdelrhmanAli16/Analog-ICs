# Lectures – Electronic Systems (All Parts)

This folder contains lecture materials from the **Electronic Systems** course, covering two major areas of analog system design: **Active Filters** and **Signal Generation & Regulation Circuits**.
These topics are essential for building real-world analog front-ends, waveform generators, and regulated power supplies.

##  Lecture Structure

### 🔹 Part I – Active Filters
Focuses on frequency-selective circuits and their implementation using Op-Amps.

- Introduction to Filters  
- Low Pass, High Pass, and Band Pass Filters  
- Butterworth, Chebyshev, and Bessel Filters  
- KHN Biquad Filter  
- Multiple Feedback and State Variable Filters  

> 📁 See `Lectures/Part1/` for detailed notes and design techniques

### 🔹 Part II – Oscillators, Multivibrators & Voltage Regulators
Covers circuits used for waveform generation, timing control, and power regulation.

- RC, LC, and Crystal Oscillators  
- Wien Bridge Oscillator  
- Astable, Monostable, and Bistable Multivibrators  
- Linear Voltage Regulators (Zener, Series, IC-based)
