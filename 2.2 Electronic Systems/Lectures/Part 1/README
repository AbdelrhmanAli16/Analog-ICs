# Lectures – Electronic Systems (Part I: Active Filters)

This folder contains detailed lecture content on **Active Filters**, which form the first part of the *Electronic Systems* course.
The focus is on understanding frequency-selective analog circuits and how different filter types are designed, implemented, and applied using operational amplifiers.
