This folder includes the study material from the Basic Electronics course.
It follows the structure of the course and the main reference: *"Microelectronics" by Jacob Millman.*

## Course Topics
1. **Semiconductor Materials**  
   Energy bands, intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors, doping.

2. **Pâ€“N Junction and Diodes**  
   Junction behavior, biasing, diode equation, types of diodes.

3. **Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs)**  
   Construction, operation modes, input/output characteristics.

4. **Field Effect Transistors (FETs)**  
   JFET, MOSFET, transfer characteristics, biasing.

5. **Applications**  
   Rectifiers, amplifiers, logic circuits.
