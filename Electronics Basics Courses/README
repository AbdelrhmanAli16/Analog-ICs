# Basic Electronics Course

This folder contains all materials related to the **Basic Electronics** course I completed as part of my undergraduate electronics engineering studies.
The course covered both theoretical foundations and hands-on lab work, focused on analog components and circuit behavior.

## Course Topics

1. **Semiconductor Materials**
2. **P–N Junction Diodes**
3. **Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs)**
4. **Field Effect Transistors (FETs)**
5. **Basic Analog Applications**

> **Reference Textbook**:  
> *Microelectronics* by **Jacob Millman**

## Folder Structure

### `/lectures/`  
Lecture materials and summaries.

### `/lab/`  
Practical lab experiments including diode circuits, rectifiers, clippers/clampers, BJT switching, and more. Most experiments were simulated using **Proteus** and built physically.

### `/sheets/`  
Problem sheets with complete solutions. Designed to strengthen theoretical understanding and problem-solving techniques.

## Tools Used

- **Proteus** – Circuit simulation
- **Handwritten notes** – Scanned and organized
