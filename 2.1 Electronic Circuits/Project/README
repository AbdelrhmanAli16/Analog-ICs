# Project â€“ Infrared Sensor Testboard

This folder contains the complete documentation, simulation, and hardware design for a custom **Infrared (IR) Sensor System**.
The project includes both simulation in **Proteus** and a functional hardware implementation using a custom-built testboard and power supply.

##  Project Overview
The goal of this project is to **design, simulate, and implement an IR sensor-based detection circuit** using discrete analog components.
A dedicated **power supply testboard** was also developed to provide the required regulated voltage for the IR system.

##  Components and Subsystems
1. Infrared Sensor Module
- IR emitter and photodiode/phototransistor pair  
- Signal conditioning with Op-Amps (comparator, amplifier stages)  
- Output LED indicator for detection  
- Sensitivity control via potentiometer

2. Power Supply Unit
- Built on a separate testboard  
- Converts AC to DC (e.g., 5V or 9V)  
- Includes transformer, bridge rectifier, filter capacitor, voltage regulator  
- Supplies power to IR sensor board

##  Simulation
- **Tool:** Proteus  
- **Files:** `.DSN`, `.PDSPRJ`  
- Includes full schematic of the IR system and power supply  
- Real-time detection behavior visualized via LED and waveform probes
