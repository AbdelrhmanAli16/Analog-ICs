# Sheets – Electronic Circuits (All Parts)

This folder collects all problem sheets and their corresponding solutions for both parts of the **Electronic Circuits** course:

- **Part I – Operational Amplifiers**
- **Part II – Core Analog Building Blocks** (Feedback, Power Amplifiers, Current Mirrors, Differential Amps)

##  Overview

Each problem sheet is designed to strengthen your understanding of the concepts taught in the lectures.
These exercises include both theoretical derivations and practical circuit problems.

##  Organization

Sheets are grouped by part:
- `Part1/` → Op-Amp focused sheets and solutions  
- `Part2/` → Sheets related to feedback, power stages, current mirrors, and differential pairs

Each subfolder includes:
- Problem sheets (PDFs)  
- Fully solved versions with explanations
