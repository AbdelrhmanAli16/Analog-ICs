#  Electronic Circuits
This folder documents my complete study of the **Electronic Circuits** course, as part of my personal analog IC design journey.
It includes carefully organized lectures, solved sheets, lab simulations, and a final project — all focused on building strong practical and theoretical understanding in analog design.

##  Folder Structure

### Lecture Breakdown
The lectures are divided into two parts:
#### Part I – Operational Amplifiers
- Amplifier basics and Op-Amp architecture  
- Ideal vs. real Op-Amp properties  
- Inverting/non-inverting configurations, filters, and comparators  

#### Part II – Core Analog Building Blocks
- Feedback theory and amplifier stability  
- Power amplifiers (Class A, B, AB)  
- Current mirrors (basic, cascode)  
- Differential amplifiers and biasing circuits  

> 📁 See: `Lectures/` for detailed content and summaries  
> 📁 See: `Sheets/Part1/` and `Sheets/Part2/` for problem-solving practice

---

###  Labs
Hands-on simulations of analog subcircuits using **Proteus**, including:
- Op-Amp configurations and applications  
- Feedback loop behavior and gain control  
- Current mirror topologies and performance metrics

Each lab includes schematic files (`.DSN`, `.PDSPRJ`) and testbench setup.

> 📁 See: `Labs/` folder

###  Final Project
A complete analog system built using discrete components:

**Infrared Sensor Testboard**
- Includes IR emitter + photodiode  
- Signal conditioning with Op-Amps  
- Indicator LED for detection  
- Powered using a custom-designed power supply on a separate testboard  
- Simulated using Proteus and implemented in hardware

> 📁 See: `Project/` for design files, simulation, photos, and report

###  Tools Used
- **Proteus** for circuit simulation  
- **Handwritten and typed notes** for conceptual understanding  
- **Breadboard + soldered testboards** for physical implementation  
- Organized in Markdown for GitHub-based presentation and tracking
