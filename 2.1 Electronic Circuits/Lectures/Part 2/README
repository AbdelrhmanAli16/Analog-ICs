This section continues the core concepts of analog circuit design, focusing on key building blocks used in both discrete and integrated systems.
The topics in this part serve as a bridge between basic amplifier theory and more advanced analog IC design practices.

# Topics Covered
1.Feedback Amplifiers
-Fundamentals of feedback in amplifiers
-Negative vs. positive feedback
-Effects on gain, bandwidth, input/output resistance, stability
-Topologies: voltage-voltage, current-voltage, etc.

2.Power Amplifiers
-Classification (Class A, B, AB, etc.)
-Efficiency and distortion trade-offs
-Push-pull operation and biasing techniques
-Thermal considerations and practical constraints

3.Current Mirrors
-Basic current mirror operation
-Improved designs: Wilson, cascode mirrors
-Output resistance, accuracy, compliance range
-Role in biasing and active loads in analog ICs

4.Differential Amplifiers
-Operation principles and common-mode rejection
-Single-ended vs. differential outputs
-Input-output characteristics
-Role in the input stage of Op-Amps
