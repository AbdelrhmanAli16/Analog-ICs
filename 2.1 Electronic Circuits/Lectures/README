This folder contains structured lecture materials from the Electronic Circuits course.
The content is divided into two parts, covering both the fundamental and advanced building blocks of analog circuit design.
These lectures are part of my personal journey in analog IC design and are supplemented with notes, simulations, and circuit analysis.

# Lecture Structure
ðŸ”¹ Part I â€“ Operational Amplifiers
Focuses on the theory, internal architecture, and applications of Op-Amps, a key component in analog systems.

-Introduction to Amplifiers

-Operational Amplifier Architecture

-Op-Amp Properties and Performance Metrics

-Op-Amp Applications in Signal Conditioning and Processing

ðŸ”¹ Part II â€“ Core Analog Building Blocks
Covers essential analog subcircuits commonly used in both discrete circuits and IC design.

-Feedback Amplifiers

-Power Amplifiers

-Current Mirrors

-Differential Amplifiers
