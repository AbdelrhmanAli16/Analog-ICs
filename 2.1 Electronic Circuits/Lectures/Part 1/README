Welcome to the Lectures section of the Electronic Circuits course.
This part focuses on the theory and design principles of Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps) â€” a foundational component in analog circuit design.

# Topics Covered

1. Introduction to Amplifiers
-Basic amplifier concepts
-Gain types: voltage, current, and power
-Brief on frequency response

2. Operational Amplifier Architecture
-Internal building blocks (differential pair, current mirrors, gain/output stages)
-Importance of each block in performance

3.Operational Amplifier Properties
-Ideal vs. real Op-Amp behavior
-Key parameters: input/output resistance, gain, bandwidth, CMRR, PSRR, slew rate, offset, and more

4.Operational Amplifier Applications
-Inverting and non-inverting amplifiers
-Integrators, differentiators, filters
-Use in signal conditioning, comparators, and analog computation
