This folder contains practical lab experiments that reinforce the theoretical concepts discussed in the lectures of the Electronic Circuits course.
All simulations are performed using Proteus, and all related files are uploaded and organized by topic.

## Lab Topics
1. Operational Amplifiers
Inverting and Non-Inverting Configurations
Op-Amp as a Comparator
Op-Amp-based Integrator and Differentiator
Practical limitations: slew rate, offset, saturation

2. Feedback Amplifiers
Closed-loop gain behavior
Effect of negative feedback on gain, input/output resistance
Frequency response with and without feedback
Stability considerations in feedback systems

3. Current Mirrors
Basic Current Mirror using BJTs and MOSFETs
Accuracy vs. output resistance
Cascode Current Mirror simulation
Current biasing applications

## Simulation Environment
Tool Used: Proteus
File Types: .DSN (design file), .PDSPRJ (project file), and simulation-ready circuit diagrams

## Each lab includes:
Circuit schematic
Testbench setup (DC/AC analysis or transient response)
Probe points and simulation parameters
Optional notes or result captures
